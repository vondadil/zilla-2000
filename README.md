Special Thanks to [grassmunk](https://github.com/grassmunk) (Chicago95), [matthewmx86](https://github.com/matthewmx86) (RetroThemesFirefox), [MrOtherGuy](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy) (Firefox CSS Hacks) and [jdan](https://github.com/jdan) (98.css) for inspiration and previous work :) 

(Loosely) based on the Netscape4 theme from [matthewmx86/RetroThemesFirefox](https://github.com/matthewmx86/RetroThemesFirefox)

# Installation

1. Enable the Title Bar (Right-Click on the empty space in the Main Toolbar, click `Customize` and enable the `Title Bar` checkbox on the bottom)
2. (Optional) Enable the Menu Bar (Right-Click on the empty space in the Main Toolbar and select the `Menu Bar` checkbox)
3. Go to `about:support`, find the entry for your profile directory  and click `Open Directory`
4. Download this repository and copy the folder `Netscape4/chrome` into your profile directory
5. Go to `about:config`, search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to true by double-clicking the list entry
5. Restart Firefox

At the moment, not enabling the Title Bar will result in visual bugs.
