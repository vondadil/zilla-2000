Work in Progress

A rewrite of the Netscape theme from matthewmx86/RetroThemesFirefox for modern 2026 Firefox.

**DO NOT USE YET - Still in early development**



# Installation

1. Enable the Title Bar (Right-Click on the empty space in the Main Toolbar, click `Customize` and enable the `Title Bar` checkbox on the bottom)
2. (Optional) Enable the Menu Bar (Right-Click on the empty space in the Main Toolbar and select the `Menu Bar` checkbox)
3. Go to `about:support`, find the entry for your profile directory  and click `Open Directory`
4. Download this repository and copy the folder `Netscape4/chrome` into your profile directory
5. Go to `about:config`, search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to true by double-clicking the list entry
5. Restart Firefox

At the moment, not enabling the Title Bar will result in visual bugs.
